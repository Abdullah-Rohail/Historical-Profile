			<h2>Here's a Time Line Of Some Steve Job's Greatest Moments</h2>
	        <ol>
	        	<li>Jobs founds Apple</li>
	        		<ul>
	        			<li><b>1976</b> - Born in 1955, by 1976 he teamed up with his friend, handily a computer genius, Steve Wozniak and founded a new computer company, called Apple. By 1980 it had become the biggest stock market launch since Ford in the 50s.</li>
	        		</ul>
	    		<li>What he wants, he gets</li>
	    			<ul>
	    				<li><b>1983</b> - After a couple of turbulent years, Jobs was in need of a new experienced exec to become president of Apple, and so lured John Sculley, then president of PepsiCo, to his company with the immortal words: “Do you want to sell sugared
	            water for the rest of your life, or do you want to come with me and change the world?” After throwing in a desk tidy and use of the executive washroom, we imagine, he accepted.</li>
	    			</ul>
	    		<li>Jobs proves he’s bigger than Apple</li>
	    			<ul>
	    				<li><b>1985</b> - A sales slump of 1984 and Jobs’ lack of business acumen caused tensions within Apple that led to a falling out with Sculley, as Jobs quit. Did he get a part time gig in a burger bar? Go on the dole? No, instead he bought a fledgling
	            computer company called Pixar (which after Toy Story in 1995 made him worth $1.5 billion) and founded NeXT, which Apple bought for $400 million, bringing Jobs back in the game. Show off.</li>
	    			</ul>
	    		<li>The prodigal son returns</li>
	    			<ul>
	    				<li><b>1997</b> - As Apple’s new Interim CEO, Jobs immediately terminated Newton, Cyberdog and OpenDoc. Employees fear meeting him in case they are fired. But guess who was recruited? Yes, the British design wizard Jonathan Ive. The partnership
	            caused aesthetic alchemy, and the pair began work on the most beautiful gadgets the world has ever seen.</li>
	             	</ul>
	    		<li>1000 songs in your pocket</li>
	    			<ul>
	    				<li><b>2001</b> - In 2001 all eyes were on the chubby little portable white box that held 1,000 songs and cost £349. Jobs proclaims: “Apple has invented a whole new category of digital music player”. Our own Lord Sugar proclaims it would be kaput
	            by Christmas. 250 million units sold worldwide. Jobs becomes known as a master of the presentation and the first Apple retail stores open.</li>
	    			</ul>
	    		<li>Jesus Phone is born</li>
	    			<ul>
	    				<li><b>2007</b> - Not content with changing music storage forever, now the tireless Jobs decides to change mobile phones forever. He and Jonathan Ive manage to create a vision of minimalist beauty, the common man coos and queues outside Apple’s
	            worldwide stores. Fingers orgasm while sliding across a scratch resistant liquid crystal display, the word ‘iPhone’ is used more than ‘phone’. And the good Jobs said it was good.</li>
	    			</ul>
	    		<li>There’s an app for that</li>
	    			<ul>
	    				<li><b>2008</b> - When the iPhone platform became available for external app developers a whole new world was opened, as if, like Steve, his phones had dropped acid and opened their eyes to a land of endless possibility. Over 16 billion apps have
	            now been downloaded, and we bet the first one you remember downloading was Angry Birds, right?</li>
	    			</ul>
				<li>Ain’t nothing gonna stop us now</li>
					<ul>
						<li><b>2010</b> - In 2003 Steve Jobs was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer, which has a horrifyingly low survival rate. He appeared to be on the up following a successful liver transplant, but things looked grave in 2009 when he took half a year
	            medical leave. When he returned, looking gaunt, what did he do? He unveiled the iPhone 4, and the iPad, changing yet another area of technology forever.</li>
					</ul>					
	        </ol>    
	     
	        <blockquote cite="http://www.cheatsheet.com/technology/20-most-memorable-quotes-from-steve-jobs.html/?a=viewall"><p>&quot;Your time is limited, don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma, which is living the result of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of other opinions drown your own inner voice. And most important, have the
	          courage to follow your heart and intuition, they somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.&quot;</p>
	          <p>~ Steve Jobs</p>
